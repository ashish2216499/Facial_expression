# Facial_expression
This project helps you see your emotions on screen in real-time! It uses a webcam to capture your video and then analyzes your face to guess what emotion you're feeling. Here's how it works:

OpenCV: This library helps access your webcam and capture video frames.
DeepFace: This library is like a super recognizer for faces. It takes a picture of your face and compares it to a giant library of emotions to make its best guess.
Drawing: The code uses Python functions to draw a box around your face and write down the emotion DeepFace thinks you're feeling.
So, while you laugh or frown, the program watches and tries to keep up with your feelings! Note that DeepFace and OpenCV are separate tools you need to install for this project to work.
